Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered.

   Number = {1–3},
   Pages = {199-230},
   Abstract = {The low-energy Feshbach resonances recently observed in the inter-particle interactions of trapped ultra-cold atoms involve an intermediate quasi-bound molecule with a spin arrangement that differs from the trapped atom spins. Variations of the strength of an external magnetic field then alter the difference of the initial and intermediate state energies (i.e. the ‘detuning’). The effective scattering length that describes the low-energy binary collisions, similarly varies with the near-resonant magnetic field. Since the properties of the dilute atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) are extremely sensitive to the value of the scattering length, a ‘tunable’ scattering length suggests very interesting many-body studies. In this paper, we review the theory of the binary collision Feshbach resonances, and we discuss their effects on the many-body physics of the condensate. We point out that the Feshbach resonance physics in a condensate can be considerably richer than that of an altered scattering length: the Feshbach resonant atom–molecule coupling can create a second condensate component of molecules that coexists with the atomic condensate. Far off-resonance, a stationary condensate does behave as a single condensate with effective binary collision scattering length. However, even in the off-resonant limit, the dynamical response of the condensate mixture to a sudden change in the external magnetic field carries the signature of the molecular condensate's presence: experimentally observable oscillations of the number of atoms and molecules. We also discuss the stationary states of the near-resonant condensate system. We point out that the physics of a condensate that is adiabatically tuned through resonance depends on its history, i.e. whether the condensate starts out above or below resonance. Furthermore, we show that the density dependence of the many-body ground-state energy suggests the possibility of creating a dilute condensate system with the liquid-like property of a self-determined density.},

   Abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses optical dipole traps for neutral atoms. Methods for storage and trapping of charged and neutral particles have very often served as the experimental key to great scientific advances, covering physics in the vast energy range from elementary particles to ultracold atomic quantum matter. It describes the basic physics of dipole trapping in fardetuned light, the typical experimental techniques and procedures, and the different trap types currently available, along with their specific features. In the experiments discussed, optical dipole traps have already shown great promise for a variety of different applications. Of particular importance is the trapping of atoms in the absolute internal ground state, which cannot be trapped magnetically. In this state, inelastic binary collisions are completely suppressed for energetic reasons. In this respect, an ultracold cesium gas represents a particularly interesting situation, because Bose–Einstein condensation seems attainable only for the absolute ground state. Therefore, an optical trap may be the only way to realize a quantum-degenerate gas of Cs atoms. Further, optical dipole traps can be seen as storage devices at the low end of the presently explorable energy scale. Future experiments exploiting the particular advantages of these traps can reveal interesting new phenomena.},

The classical adiabatic rapid passage, which is a fundamental element upon which all adiabatic pulses and sequences are based, is analyzed using vector models in different rotating frames of reference. Two methods to optimize adiabaticity are described, and ways to tailor modulation functions to best satisfy specific experimental needs are demonstrated. Finally, adiabatic plane rotation pulses and frequency-selective multiple spin-echo sequences are considered.},

Although TG gas bosons are strongly interacting, they behave very much like noninteracting fermions. We enter the TG regime with cold rubidium-87 atoms by trapping them with a combination of two light traps. By changing the trap intensities, and hence the atomic interaction strength, the atoms can be made to act either like a Bose-Einstein condensate or like a TG gas. We measure the total 1D energy and the length of the gas. With no free parameters and over a wide range of coupling strengths, our data fit the exact solution for the ground state of a 1D Bose gas.},

   Abstract = {We study the horizontal transport of ultracold atoms over macroscopic distances of up to 20 cm with a moving 1D optical lattice. By using an optical Bessel beam to form the optical lattice, we can achieve nearly homogeneous trapping conditions over the full transport length, which is crucial in order to hold the atoms against gravity for such a wide range. Fast transport velocities of up to 6 m s −1 (corresponding to about 1100 photon recoils) and accelerations of up to 2600 m s −2 are reached. Even at high velocities the momentum of the atoms is precisely defined with an uncertainty of less than one photon recoil. This allows for construction of an atom catapult with high kinetic energy resolution, which might have applications in novel collision experiments.},

   Abstract = {We report the transport of ultracold atoms with optical tweezers in the non-adiabatic regime, i.e. on a time scale on the order of the oscillation period. We have found a set of discrete transport durations for which the transport is not accompanied by any excitation of the centre of mass of the cloud after the transport. We show that the residual amplitude of oscillation of the dipole mode is given by the Fourier transform of the velocity profile imposed to the trap for the transport. This formalism leads to a simple interpretation of our data and simple methods for optimizing trapped particles displacement in the non-adiabatic regime.},

   Abstract = {We analyze the results of a recent experiment with bosonic rubidium atoms harmonically confined in a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) geometry. In this experiment a well-defined critical point was identified, which separates the high-temperature normal state characterized by a single component density distribution, and the low-temperature state characterized by a bimodal density distribution and the emergence of high-contrast interference between independent 2D clouds. We first show that this transition cannot be explained in terms of conventional Bose–Einstein condensation of the trapped ideal Bose gas. Using the local density approximation (LDA), we then combine the mean-field (MF) Hartree–Fock theory with the prediction for the Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless (BKT) transition in an infinite uniform system. If the gas is treated as a strictly 2D system, the MF predictions for the spatial density profiles significantly deviate from those of a recent quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis. However, when the residual thermal excitation of the strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account, excellent agreement is reached between the MF and the QMC approaches. For the interaction strength corresponding to the experiment, we predict a strong correction to the critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory (factor ~2). Quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature calibration.},

After preparing a spin-mixture of ultracold atoms in an antiferromagnetically ordered state, we measured coherent superexchange-mediated spin dynamics with coupling energies from 5 hertz up to 1 kilohertz. By dynamically modifying the potential bias between neighboring lattice sites, the magnitude and sign of the superexchange interaction can be controlled, thus allowing the system to be switched between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic spin interactions. We compare our findings to predictions of a two-site Bose-Hubbard model and find very good agreement, but are also able to identify corrections that can be explained by the inclusion of direct nearest-neighbor interactions.},

We use superlattice manipulations to perform entangling operations between neighbouring qubits encoded on the Zeeman levels of the atoms without having to perform transfers between the different vibrational states of the atoms. We show how to use superlattices to engineer many-body entangled states resilient to collective dephasing noise. Also, we present a method to realize a two-dimensional (2D) resource for measurement-based quantum computing via Bell-pair measurements. We analyse measurement networks that allow the execution of quantum algorithms while maintaining the resilience properties of the system throughout the computation.},

   Abstract = {We show that there are effective three- and higher-body interactions generated by the two-body collisions of atoms confined in the lowest vibrational states of a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice. The collapse and revival dynamics of approximate coherent states loaded into a lattice are a particularly sensitive probe of these higher-body interactions; the visibility of interference fringes depend on both two-, three- and higher-body energy scales, and these produce an initial dephasing that can help explain the surprisingly rapid decay of revivals seen in experiments. If inhomogeneities in the lattice system are sufficiently reduced, longer timescale partial and nearly full revivals will be visible. Using Feshbach resonances or control of the lattice potential it is possible to tune the effective higher-body interactions and simulate effective field theories in optical lattices.},

   Abstract = {We demonstrate a digital micromirror device (DMD)-based optical system that converts a spatially noisy quasi-Gaussian to an eighth-order super-Lorentzian flat-top beam. We use an error-diffusion algorithm to design the binary pattern for the Texas Instruments DLP device. Following the DMD, a telescope with a pinhole low-pass filters the beam and scales it to the desired sized image. Experimental measurements show a 1% root-mean-square (RMS) flatness over a diameter of 0.28 mm in the center of the flat-top beam and better than 1.5% RMS flatness over its entire 1.43 mm diameter. The power conversion efficiency is 37%. We develop an alignment technique to ensure that the DMD pattern is correctly positioned on the incident beam. An interferometric measurement of the DMD surface flatness shows that phase uniformity is maintained in the output beam. Our approach is highly flexible and is able to produce not only flat-top beams with different parameters, but also any slowly varying target beam shape. It can be used to generate the homogeneous optical lattice required for Bose-Einstein condensate cold atom experiments.},

   Abstract = {Engineering optical lattices with laser-induced tunnelling amplitudes has enabled the realization of artificial magnetic fields with remarkable tunability. Here, we report on the observation of chiral Meissner currents in bosonic ladders exposed to a strong artificial magnetic field. By suddenly decoupling the individual ladders and projecting into isolated double wells, we are able to measure the currents on each side of the ladder. For large coupling strengths along the rungs of the ladder, we find a saturated maximum chiral current, which is analogous to the surface currents in the Meissner effect. Below a critical inter-leg coupling strength, the chiral current decreases in good agreement with our expectations for a vortex lattice phase. Our realization of a low-dimensional Meissner-like effect and spin-orbit coupling in one dimension opens the path to exploring interacting particles in low dimensions exposed to a uniform magnetic field.},

We demonstrate creation and analysis of entangled states with mean atom numbers up to 41 and experimentally prove multiparticle entanglement. Our method is independent of atom number and should allow generalization to other entangled states and other physical implementations including circuit quantum electrodynamics.},

The scheme allows us to shift the focus position at constant waist, providing uniform trapping conditions over the full transport length. The fraction of atoms that are transported over the entire distance comes near to unity, while the heating of the cloud is in the range of a few microkelvin. We characterize the position stability of the focus and show that residual drift rates in focus position can be compensated for by counteracting with the tunable lenses. Beyond being a compact and robust scheme to transport ultracold atoms, the reported control of laser beams makes dynamic tailoring of trapping potentials possible. As an example, we steer the size of the atomic cloud by changing the waist size of the dipole beam.},

   Title = {Artificial gauge fields with ultracold atoms in optical lattices},
   Type = {Dissertation, LMU Munich},
   Abstract = {This thesis reports on the generation of artificial magnetic fields with ultracold atoms in optical lattice potentials using laser-assisted tunneling, as well as on the first Chern-number measurement in a non-electronic system. The high experimental controllability of cold atoms in optical lattices makes them suitable candidates to study condensed matter Hamiltonians, where the atoms play the role of the electrons. However, the observation of magnetic field effects in these systems is challenging because the atoms are charge neutral and do not experience a Lorentz force. In the context of this thesis a new experimental technique for the generation of effective magnetic fields with laser-assisted tunneling was demonstrated, which mimics the physics of charged particles in real magnetic fields. The applied laser beams create a periodic on-site modulation whose phase depends on the position in the lattice and leads to complex tunnel couplings. An atom that hops around a closed loop in this system picks up a non-zero phase, which is reminiscent of the Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by a charged particle in a magnetic field. The corresponding time-dependent Hamiltonian is typically described in terms of an effective time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian. In this work a theoretical description of the underlying full-time dynamics that occurs within one driving period and goes beyond the simple time-independent picture is presented. In the experiment the laser-assisted-tunneling method was implemented for staggered as well as uniform flux distributions, where the latter is a realization of the Harper-Hofstadter model for a flux Phi=pi/2 per lattice unit cell. By exploiting an additional pseudo-spin degree of freedom the same experimental setup led to the observation of the spin Hall effect in an optical lattice. Using the unique experimental detection and manipulation techniques offered by a two-dimensional bichromatic superlattice potential the strength of the artificial magnetic field and its spatial distribution could be determined through the observation of quantum cyclotron orbits on the level of isolated four-site square plaquettes. The band structure in the presence of a uniform magnetic field is topologically non-trivial and is characterized by the Chern number, a 2D topological invariant, which is at the origin of the quantized Hall conductance observed in electronic systems. In order to probe the topology of the bands the techniques mentioned above were refined by developing a new all-optical laser-assisted tunneling setup, which enabled the first experimental determination of the Chern number in a non-electronic system. The presented measurements and techniques offer a unique setting to study the properties of topological systems with ultracold atoms. All experimental techniques that were developed in the context of this thesis with bosonic atoms can be directly applied to fermionic systems.},

   Abstract = {The dynamics of quantum phase transitions pose one of the most challenging problems in modern many-body physics. Here, we study a prototypical example in a clean and well-controlled ultracold atom setup by observing the emergence of coherence when crossing the Mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition. In the 1D Bose–Hubbard model, we find perfect agreement between experimental observations and numerical simulations for the resulting coherence length. We, thereby, perform a largely certified analog quantum simulation of this strongly correlated system reaching beyond the regime of free quasiparticles. Experimentally, we additionally explore the emergence of coherence in higher dimensions, where no classical simulations are available, as well as for negative temperatures. For intermediate quench velocities, we observe a power-law behavior of the coherence length, reminiscent of the Kibble–Zurek mechanism. However, we find nonuniversal exponents that cannot be captured by this mechanism or any other known model.},

   Abstract = {The geometric structure of a single-particle energy band in a solid is fundamental for a wide range of many-body phenomena and is uniquely characterized by the distribution of Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. We realize an atomic interferometer to measure Berry flux in momentum space, in analogy to an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer that measures magnetic flux in real space. We demonstrate the interferometer for a graphene-type hexagonal optical lattice loaded with bosonic atoms. By detecting the singular π Berry flux localized at each Dirac point, we establish the high momentum resolution of this interferometric technique. Our work forms the basis for a general framework to fully characterize topological band structures.},
